# Do you trust your data?  A comparison of 3 data sources for Covid-19 analysis.

## Using the 3 different data sets, compare the following 5 U.S. states:
* Florida
* Georgia
* New York
* Texas
* Washington 

## Hypothesis:
* Comparing 3 Covid-19 datasets will show inconsistencies in data reporting.

## Questions for analysis:
* How do the 3 datasets compare?  Are there any consistencies in data?  Is there any bias in the data sources?
* What % of population is tested?  How much does testing vary from state to state?
* Was there any impact from the state shutdown and reopening timing on these five states?

## Why did we pick those specific states?
* Florida is currently at #2 in the total positive cases counts. Florida's cases starting increasing to over 1,000 per day on 6/6/20.  The largest daily spike so far occured on 7/12/20 at 15,135.  The seven day average is currently 11,006.  Did reopening timing have an impact?  Is this spike due to Florida being a summer destination spot?
* Georgia is currently #8 on the list.  The largest daily spike occured on 7/18/20 at 4,689 cases per day.  Current 7 day moving average is 3,495 cases per day.  This state seems to be trending in the wrong direction.  Again, did shutdown and reopening timing have an impact on this trend?
* New York is currently #4 on the list.  The largest daily spike occured on 4/10/20 at 8,593 cases per day.  The current 7 day average is 324 new cases per day.  This trended in the right direction for an extended period of time.  Did the shutdown and reopening timing have an impact on this trend?
* Texas is currently coming in at #3 on the list.  Texas started seeing daily cases over 1,000 starting 5/5/20.  The largest daily spike so far occured on 7/17/20 at 14,916 cases per day.  The seven day average is currently 9,893.
* We picked Washington because it was the first state in the United States with a Covid-19 case.  As of 7/22/20, Washington is currently down to #22 on the overall positive case counts for the U.S.  Washington's spike in cases occured on 4/3/20 at 1,283 cases per day with another large spike on 4/7/20 at 1,364. The current 7 day average is 886 cases.  Did the shutdown and reopening timing have an effect on their current number of positive cases?
