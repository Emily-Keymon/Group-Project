# Do you trust your data?  A comparison of 3 data sources for Covid-19 analysis.

## Data comparison for 5 U.S. states using 3 different datasets â€“ 
* Florida
* Georgia
* New York
* Texas
* Washington 

## Questions for analysis:
* How do the 3 datasets compare?  Are there any consistencies in data?  Is there any bias in the data sources?
* What % of population is tested?  How much does testing vary from state to state?
* Was there any impact from the state shutdown and reopening timing on these five states?

## Why did we pick those specific states?
*  We picked Washington because it was the first state in the United States with a Covid-19 case.  The rest of the country watched the nightmare unfold in disbelief.  Where are they now?  Did the shutdown and reopening timing have an effect on their current number of positive cases?  As of 7/23/2020, Washington is currently down to #22 on the overall positive case counts for the U.S.
* Florida is currently at #2 in the total positive cases counts. Florida's cases starting increasing to over 1,000 per day starting 6/6/2020.  The largest daily spike so far occured on 7/12/2020 at 15,135.  Did reopening timing have an impact?  Is this spike due to Florida being a summer destination spot?
* With Texas coming in at #3.  
* New York got the worst out break 

* New York and Texas are currently in the top 10 of positive cases in the country.  Florida is #2, Texas is #3 and New York is #5.
