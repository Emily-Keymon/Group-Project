# Do you trust your data?  A comparison of 3 data sources for Covid-19 analysis.

## Data comparison for 5 U.S. states using 3 different datasets â€“ 
* Florida
* Georgia
* New York
* Texas
* Washington 

## Questions for analysis:
* How do the 3 datasets compare?  Are there any consistencies in data?  Is there any bias in the data sources?
* What % of population is tested?  How much does testing vary from state to state?
* Was there any impact from the state shutdown and reopening timing on these five states?

## Why did we pick those specific states?
*  We picked Washington because it was the first state in the United States with a Covid-19 case.  As of 7/22/2020, Washington is currently down to #22 on the overall positive case counts for the U.S.  Washington's spike in cases occured on 4/3/2020 at 1,283 with another large spike on 4/7/2020 at 1,364. The current 7 day average is 886 cases.   Did the shutdown and reopening timing have an effect on their current number of positive cases? 
* Florida is currently at #2 in the total positive cases counts. Florida's cases starting increasing to over 1,000 per day starting 6/6/2020.  The largest daily spike so far occured on 7/12/2020 at 15,135.  The seven day average is currently 11, 006.  Did reopening timing have an impact?  Is this spike due to Florida being a summer destination spot?
* Texas is currently coming in at #3 on the list.  Texas started seeing daily cases over 1,000 starting 5/5/2020.  The largest daily spike so far occured on 7/17/2020 at 14,196.  The seven day average is currently 9,893.
* New York is currently #4 on the list.  The largest daily spike occured on 4/10/2020 at 8,593 cases per day.  The current 7 day average is 324 new cases per day.  This trended in the right direction for an extended period of time.  Did the shutdown and reopening timing have this impact?

* Georgia is currently #8 on the list.  The largest daily spike occured on 7/18/2020.  Current 7 day moving average is 7,795 cases per day.  This state seems to be trending in the wrong direction.  Again, did shutdown and reopening timing have this impact?
