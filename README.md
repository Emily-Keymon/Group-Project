# DO YOU TRUST YOUR DATA?
## COVID-19 comparison analysis utilizing three data sources

## Data comparison of the following five states:
* Florida
* Georgia
* New York
* Texas
* Washington 

## Questions for analysis:
* How do the three data sets compare?  Are there any consistencies in data?  Is there any bias in the data sources?
* What % of population is tested?  How much does testing vary from state to state?
* Was there any impact from the state shutdown and reopening timing on these five states?
