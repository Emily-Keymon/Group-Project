# Do you trust your data?  A comparison of 3 data sources for Covid-19 analysis.

## Data comparison data from 5 U.S. states using 3 different datasets â€“ 
* Florida
* Georgia
* New York
* Texas
* Washington 

## Questions for analysis:
* How do the 3 datasets compare?  Are there any consistencies in data?  Is there any bias in the data sources?
* What % of population is tested?  How much does testing vary from state to state?
* Was there any impact from the state shutdown and reopening timing on these five states?
